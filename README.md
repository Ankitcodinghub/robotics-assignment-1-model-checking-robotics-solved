1 Introduction

Automated warehouses are growing increasingly popular in industrial and large-scale retail settings. Experts generally agree that automation in warehouse management leads to a productivity surge. Commonly observed improvements occur in terms of order handling speed and storage capabilities.

Such facilities employ large fleets of custom-tailored mobile robots (most notably, the Amazon Kiva1) to dispatch goods to their destination on the shop floor. These devices can synchronize with each other and inspect the environment to avoid collisions while carrying large storage pods.

Human operators are still involved in residual manual tasks at the edge of the system, such as collecting or stowing products from and in the pods. Minimizing human presence in the core section of the warehouse reduces the likelihood of error while also increasing safety on the shop floor.

The goal of the project is to exploit formal verification techniquesâ€”specifically model-checkingâ€”to:

<ol>
<li>model the core entities of an automated warehouse (expanded in Section 2);</li>
<li>verify critical properties concerning traffic management and efficiency (expanded in Section 3).</li>
</ol>
2 Model

In the following, we describe:

â€¢ the entities have to be mandatorily featured by the model; â€¢ the mandatory features and behavioral aspects;

â€¢ the simplifying assumptions;

â€¢ optional extra features.

2.1 Environment

As mentioned in Section 1, robots are deployed on warehouse shop floors, and items are stored in storage pods.

Such floor layouts usually feature a larger area called highway where robots can roam more freely. Storage pods are lined up in a separate area, and pod rows are separated by smaller lanes that allow for robot movement.

We assume that the layout can be represented as a grid. Each cell is roughly as big as a mobile robot. Therefore, only one robot at a time can occupy a cell (except for the entry point). Some cells are free, some are occupied by a pod. Figure 1 represents a sample layout, constituted by a 10 Ã— 10 grid, to be considered for the project.

DELIVERY POINT

<div class="column">
ENTRY POINT

Figure 1: Schematic grid-like representation of a sample floor layout. The robot highway is on the right (the dashed line is purely ornamental), whereas the area with storage pods (the yellow squares) is on the left. We assume that all robots enter the system from the entry point, and that all pods need to be delivered to the delivery point.

Â­ Optional: Design your model so that it potentially supports any rectangular grid-like layout.

Assume that there is only one entry point to the system, which is the starting position for all robots. Furthermore, assume that there is only one human operator collecting items from the pods. Robots must deliver all pods to the single delivery point. Both the delivery and entry point cell positions are known a priori.

2.2 Tasks

In this context, a task entails the retrieval and dispatch of an item stored in a specific pod. Assume that a centralized dispatching unit receives new tasks periodically each T time units, where T is a constant system parameter. Tasks are all collected in a single queue (visible to all robots), up to a maximum MAX_T, which is also a system parameter. If new tasks arrive when the queue is already full, they will be lost. A task is removed by the queue when a robot claims it (i.e., starts working on it).

Â­ Optional: The time elapsed between two tasks is a sample of a Normal distribution N âˆ¼ (Î¼T , ÏƒT ) (therefore, task arrival times are not predictable).

<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
The following phases make up each task:

1. a robot claims the task;

2. the robot fetches the requested storage pod;

3. the robot delivers the pod to the delivery point; 4. the human picks up the item;

5. the robot returns the pod to its starting position.

When a new task arrives, its corresponding pod is randomly chosen among the ones that are available. Therefore, it never happens that:

â€¢ two unclaimed tasks require the same pod;

â€¢ a new task requires a pod that is already being carried by another robot.

Robots claim tasks following the FIFO rule (the oldest one is the first one to go as soon as a robot is available).

Assume that there is no time constraint on task completion (i.e., they do not need to be completed in a set amount of time).

2.3 Robots

Robots can only perform two physical actions: â€¢ lift (or release) and carry a pod;

â€¢ move between cells.

Assume that robot movement between cells is discrete. A robot can advance by one cell every K time units, where K is the same for all areas of the layout and all robots. After time K has elapsed, the robot picks the next cell among the adjacent ones (assume that they cannot move diagonally).

When choosing the next cell, the robot must follow these rules:

<ul>
<li>it cannot occupy a cell already occupied by another robot (except for the entry point);</li>
<li>it can move under pods only if it is not carrying a pod;</li>
<li>if no adjacent cell is available, it does not move.Assume that a robot will claim a task (if at least one is available) as soon as it goes back to idle.</li>
</ul>
Â­ Optional: As soon as it goes back to idle, the robot claims a new task with a delay described by Exponential distribution X âˆ¼ (Î»).

Assume that robots have endless battery life and do not need to recharge.

2.4 Human Operator

Assume that there is only one human operator in the system, and that he/she cannot perform any physical action (they do not move).

When a robot is in the delivery cell, it takes H time units for the human to pick up the item and release the robot. The robot can return the pod only after the human has completed his task and released the robot. Assume that H is a constant parameter.

Â­ Optional: The operator reacts to the arrival of the robot and picks up the object in a time interval which is not fully predictable. Assume that it is described by a Normal distribution N âˆ¼ (Î¼H, ÏƒH).

3 Properties

We want to formally verify the efficiency of the warehouse as a function of the task queue size (MAX_T) and system parameters.

The mandatory property to be verified is: it never happens that tasks in the queue exceed its maximum size (hence, that incoming tasks get lost).

Â­ If you have included stochastic features, verify the probability that tasks in the queue exceed its maximum size.

Deliver and critically describe at least 2 system configurations: one that violates the mandatory property and one that does not. Each configuration should feature at least 3 robots and non-trivial values of system parameters (task arrival rate, task queue size, robot speed, human reaction time). Trivial values are considered so when they do not stress the system (hence making the verification irrelevant): for example, if the operator has null reaction time or if new tasks arrive every 60min when it takes 1min for a robot to complete a task.

Â­ If you have included stochastic features, the two configurations should yield different probability ranges for the mandatory property (in one case the probability of exceeding queue size should be high, in the other it should be low).

Given the unboundedness of exhaustive model-checking, assume there is a maximum amount of tasks that can be received (&gt; MAX_T).

Â­ Statistical Model-Checking is bounded. Assume that infinite tasks can be received, but properties should be checked with a time-bound TAU. The value of TAU is up to you (it can also vary across system configurations), but it should be high enough to illustrate system behavior.

4 Modeling Tool

The project will be carried out using the Uppaal2 tool. 2Uppaal.org W

<div class="column">
Â­ If you have included stochastic features, make sure you use the latest version of Uppaal with SMC extension.

The system must be modeled as a network of (optionally probabilistic) Timed Automata through the Uppaal GUI, and properties must be expressed in (optionally PCTL) CTL logic and verified through the Uppaal engine.

A hands-on introductory demo of the tool will be provided to you in the upcoming days.
